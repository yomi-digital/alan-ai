# The Dwarf and the Chicken

In a small village at the foot of the mountains lived a dwarf named Gimli. He was the smallest among all the dwarves in the village, but he had a heart as big as an oak tree. He lived alone in a pretty little house with a vegetable garden, where he grew carrots, potatoes, and cabbages.
One day, while working in his garden, he heard desperate clucking coming from the nearby woods. Curious, Gimli followed the sound until he found a copper-colored chicken struggling with its foot caught between two roots.
"Don't worry, little one," whispered the dwarf, slowly approaching so as not to frighten her. Gently, he freed the chicken's foot, and instead of running away, she looked at him with her bright, intelligent eyes.
From that day on, the chicken, whom Gimli named Ruby for her copper plumage, decided to stay with him. She wasn't an ordinary chicken: she seemed to understand everything the dwarf said to her and followed him everywhere like a faithful puppy.
Ruby proved to be an extraordinary companion. Every morning she would wake Gimli at dawn with her melodious song, very different from the typical cock-a-doodle-doo of other chickens. She helped him in the garden by pecking at harmful worms, and, strangely enough, she was excellent at finding edible mushrooms in the woods.
The other dwarves in the village initially made fun of Gimli for his unusual friendship with a chicken. But when they saw how inseparable they were and how intelligent and helpful Ruby was, they changed their minds. Soon, the strange pair became famous throughout the village.
During a particularly cold winter, when snow covered everything, Ruby saved Gimli's life. The dwarf had gone out to collect firewood and got lost in the blizzard. It was Ruby who, following a mysterious instinct, found him half-frozen and guided the rescuers to him, clucking loudly to be heard through the wind.
From then on, no one dared to question the special bond between the dwarf and his chicken. Gimli and Ruby lived many more happy years together, proving to everyone that the truest friendship can bloom in the most unexpected ways.
Even today, on winter evenings, the villagers tell their children the story of the dwarf with the big heart and his faithful chicken friend, remembering how the purest friendships know no barriers of species or size.
